# What's this now?
Pick who goes next, replace a coin flip, pick your lunch spot. It's up to you!

# Usage
Options should be passed in via query string in a comma-separated list: `?people=Person1,Person2`

The message under the crystal ball (in standups we use this spot to list the questions to answer) can be passed in via query string. Use pipes to create line breaks `message=Here's your message | and this will be on a new line`

# Development
`npm i`
`npm run start`
